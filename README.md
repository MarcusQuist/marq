# Summary
It should be noted, that the majority of the code comes from Repository I worked upon together with my group: https://github.com/MarcusQuist/architecture_prototyping/tree/main/ZeeGuu.
This repository (marq), is created to modify and extend the other repository to suit my individual report's specific target goal.
